Incorporated SVM alongside tree-based models (Decision Tree and Random Forest) in breast cancer prediction, focusing on feature relevance and model efficiency. My models surpassed baseline expectations, with Random Forest achieving a remarkable 99.2% mean ROC-AUC CV score and 98.3% accuracy on test data, and SVM also performing strongly with a 98.3% mean ROC-AUC CV score and 97.3% accuracy, underscoring their potent predictive power.
